            <p>Alan Watts has born in 1915 in Chislehurst, England. He moved to the United States in 1938 and attended Sebury-Western Theological Seminary in New York. He received a master's degree in theology and became an Episcopal priest in 1945. In 1950 he left the ministry and moved to California to head the American Academy of Asian Studies.</p>
              <div class="image3"></div>
            <p>Alan gained popularity after becoming a volunteer programmer for the KFPA Berkeley radio station which helped spearhead his career as a much sought after lecturer. Over the years he published over 25 books and articles on the topics and philosophies of both eastern and western religions. He drew influence from a myriad of sources stretching beyond religion including, science, psychology, mysticism, general semantics, and psychadelia.</p>
              <div class="image4"></div>
            <p> Watts incurred criticism for some of his interpretations of doctrine to which he responded that he was not an academic philosopher but more accurately "a philosophical entertainer." Criticism aside, Alan Watts' influence continues to this day inspiring multiple generations to explore different religions and ideas with an open mind and to look at the universe and their role in it, in a whole new way. Alan died in 1973 in Marin county California. </p>
